We have a cottage that we want to rent. It's called "Island Road Cabin". It's located in Malagash on the warm north shore of Nova Scotia. There are lots of restaurants and pubs nearby in Tatamagouche.  The cabin was recently renovated and can comfortably sleep 5 people. Enjoy the peaceful evenings away from it all. We need a static website to showcase this rental. It should be reactive and able to be hosted on github pages. There should be sections for photos of the cottage (that can expand and carousel) with a header photo and convey a peaceful ocean vibe. There should be a contact section as well as an "About Us" section. Use bootstrap and htmx. Some examples of websites we like are https://blackforestcabins.ca/, https://www.stokeresorts.com/, https://www.porterspeak.com/cabins
